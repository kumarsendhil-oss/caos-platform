# Round 2 — Voucher posting (2026-09-15, runs 15:23–15:50 UTC)

## 7. Purchase vouchers require inventory entries on inventory-enabled companies — RESOLVED

**Observed:** seven payload variants (varying OBJVIEW, PERSISTEDVIEW,
tax ledgers, voucher number, party ledger) all failed identically
against `Coastal Test Traders` with `EXCEPTIONS: 1` and no detail.
Creating the same voucher by hand in Tally revealed why: that company
has `Maintain Inventory: Yes` + `Integrate Accounts with Inventory: Yes`,
so Tally requires a stock item on a Purchase voucher. Manual entry could
not be completed without creating one.

The identical payload posted first try against `Coastal Services Ltd`
(`Maintain Inventory: No`) — `CREATED: 1`.

**Consequence for `TallyAdapter` (issue #2):** inventory handling is
**conditional on client configuration**, not universal. The adapter must
know each client's inventory setting and supply `ALLINVENTORYENTRIES.LIST`
only where required. For service-business clients — common in a CA
practice — accounting-only purchase vouchers post cleanly.

**Still unknown:** what a correct inventory-bearing voucher looks like.
Not yet tested. BK-01 currently extracts invoice line items with no
notion of mapping them to a client's stock item master; for
inventory-enabled clients that mapping is new scope, comparable to
BK-02's vendor-to-ledger matching but against stock items.

## 8. The tax split computes correctly — `GSTDUTYHEAD: CGST` works

Verified in the Tally UI, not just by read-back:

```
To  Coastal Components Pvt Ltd              21,712.00 Cr
By  Purchase @18%            18,400.00 Dr
By  CGST                      1,656.00 Dr
By  SGST                      1,656.00 Dr
```

This closes the open question from §3. `CGST` as a `GSTDUTYHEAD` value is
not merely accepted — it produces the correct intra-state split. (Whether
some other value is more canonical is still unknown; this one works.)

## 9. CG7 CONFIRMED — Tally does not prevent duplicate vouchers

Two identical imports produced two vouchers: `LASTVCHID` 1 then 2, both
`CREATED: 1, ERRORS: 0`. The Day Book shows both, and party `Cur Bal`
of 43,424.00 Cr (= 2 × 21,712) confirms both posted in full.

**ADR 0001's claim stands.** Tally's own TPA documentation states
*"invalid or duplicate requests will reflect in the error count"* —
that is **wrong** for voucher imports. CG7's platform-side duplicate
check is genuinely necessary, not defensive over-engineering.

## 10. Tally assigns its own voucher numbers, discarding ours

We sent `VOUCHERNUMBER: SVC-INV-0001`; Tally stored `1` and `2`.

Same silent-discard class as §2. It matters specifically for CG7: the
platform cannot use the voucher number as a duplicate key on Tally's
side, because it does not control that value. The check must live
entirely in the platform's own `Voucher` table — which is what CG7
specifies, so the design is right, for a reason now better understood.

**Open:** whether a supplier invoice number can be carried in a
different field (the UI shows an empty "Supplier Invoice No." on the
posted voucher). Worth testing — without it, a posted voucher has no
link back to the source document.

## 11. Our voucher read-back query is broken — spike bug, not Tally

`EXPORT / COLLECTION / TYPE: Voucher / FETCH *` returned zero vouchers
while the Day Book showed two. The vouchers exist; the query is wrong.
Note `CMPINFO.COMPANY` read `1` on these responses and `0` on earlier
ones, which may indicate a company-context problem in the request.

Unresolved. `TallyAdapter` needs a working voucher read for TC-02 and
for the read-back verification §2 makes mandatory, so this must be
fixed before issue #1 is implemented.

## 12. Tally reports import exceptions with no diagnostic detail anywhere

Checked and ruled out, all of them:

| Channel | Result |
|---|---|
| XML response | counts only |
| `tally.imp` | summaries only (whole file checked, not just tail) |
| `logs/` folder | `tallyscheduler.log` only — unrelated component |
| Data directory | binary `.TSF`, locked while Tally runs |
| `tally.ini` | no verbosity or debug setting exists |
| Calculator Pane (`Ctrl+N`) | stayed empty during a reproduced failure |

A third-party source claimed `tally.imp` *"dumps the validation errors
and unimported structures"*. It does not, at least not by default and
not with any setting exposed.

**Consequence:** when a post fails, `TallyAdapter` can report *that* it
failed but never *why*. Combined with §2 (success responses that are not
true), read-back verification is the only mechanism available for
knowing what actually happened. That belongs in ADR 0001 as a stated
constraint, not tribal knowledge.
